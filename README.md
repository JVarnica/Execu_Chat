Having a fully offline AI model to talk to when no internet was the goal. Needs to be small and converstational with easy quantifying. I wanted to stay within the PyTorch framework, and it is
very lightweight so was used instead of Tensorflow. 

App is fully running using the vulkan backend it is nearly fully delegated. .... show delegation here.  I have added voice but it uses vosk out of laziness TODO keeping the whole framework there.
as the JNI bindings work properly.
